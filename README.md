# Used_Car-Bike_Price_Prediction
With the Help of Dataset of used Car and used Bike. This Algorithm will Predict the price value of Car/Bike according to the user Needs,
Algorithm used is based on Machine Learning tenchnique and in that we used Linear Regression for prediction.
We made a Linear Regression model using sklearn library of machine learning and also we used R2_Score function of Random Forest regression for more accuracy of our model.
Firstly we found the dataset one with 6000 in number and other in 4000, we got stuck at a point as 6000 dataset has a column named mileage and 4000 datasets does not have that
column, so what we did was we made use of Linear regression to help predict us the mileage of 4000 data from the 6000 dataset, in this way we got the mileage column for 4000 dataset also.
After all the model making process (the back-end) we decided to make something to make our model look good and that can only be possible with the help of front-end,
so we the team of three finally decided to make an app or website. For that we started learning how to use flask using python to deploy our model. We then finally made the front-end using HTML, 
a bit of bootstrap and css. After the template (front-end) was ready, we connected our template with our model, precisely you can say we connected our front-end to the back-end with the help of flask.
We then finally deployed our app using the same flask. When you will go through our website you will come to know more about our project.
  Here is the link, you can visit our website where we have deployed our model:-      https://vehiclepredictions.herokuapp.com/
